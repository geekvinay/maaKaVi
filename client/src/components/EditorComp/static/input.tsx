    // which gives you a chance to write, share and learn TypeScript.

    // You could think of it in three ways:
    //
    //  - A location to learn TypeScript where nothing can break
    //  - A place to experiment with TypeScript syntax, and share the URLs with others
    //  - A sandbox to experiment with different compiler features of TypeScript

    // To learn more about the language, click above in "Examples" or "What's New".
    // Otherwise, get started by removing these comments and the world is your playground.
