# Coding Learning Platform

Welcome to the Coding Learning Platform! This project aims to create an interactive and community-driven environment where students can learn various aspects of coding. The platform is built with contributions from the open-source community, providing a rich and diverse set of lessons and resources.

## Project Overview

Our goal is to create an educational platform where students can:

- Access curated playlists of coding lessons created by the community.
- Learn from a combination of documentation and interactive elements.
- Engage with the material through an interactive code editor or quizzes.
- Discuss doubts and questions in a dedicated forum.

### Key Features

1. **Lesson Interface**
    - **Documentation (Left Side):** Comprehensive instructional content.
    - **Interactive Element (Right Side):** Tools for engaging with the material, such as:
        - **Interactive Code Editor:** Write and test code in real-time.
        - **Quizzes:** Assess understanding through interactive quizzes.

2. **Community Engagement**
    - **Forum:** A space for students to discuss their doubts and questions.
    - **Question Linking:** Users can link specific questions to their forum posts for better context and discussion.

### Phase 1 Implementation

- **Interactive Code Editor or Quiz:** For the initial phase, we are focusing on developing either an interactive code editor or quiz functionality alongside the documentation display.
