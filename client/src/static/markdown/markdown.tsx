Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage compatible,
AngularJS-powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

- Type some Markdown on the left
- See HTML in the right
- ✨Magic ✨

## Features

- Import a HTML file and watch it magically convert to Markdown
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
- Import and save files from GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive and One Drive
- Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
- Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions
that people naturally use in email.
As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable

> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually- written in Markdown! To get a feel
for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and
watch the results in the right.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.
